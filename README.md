* **Themes & Customization**
  Choose from light/dark mode and personalize accent colors to suit your aesthetic.

* **History Log (optional)**
  View past sessions with date-stamped counts to monitor your spiritual discipline.

  Offer UI in English and Arabic (and others), including right-to-left direction.
